# Glitchlings Performance Benchmarks

This page is generated by `docs/build_performance_report.py` and refreshed as part of the build pipeline. It compares the pure-Python orchestrator with the optional Rust acceleration layer exposed via `glitchlings._zoo_rust`.

## Benchmark setup

- Samples per measurement: 100
- Python: 3.12.3 (CPython)
- Platform: Windows 11 [AMD64]
- Rust extension built: yes
- Generated: 2025-10-11T04:34:55.383555+00:00

## Results

| Text size | Characters | Python (ms) | Rust (ms) | Speedup |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| short | 121 | 0.149 +/- 0.070 | 0.414 +/- 0.058 | 0.36x |
| medium | 3903 | 3.865 +/- 0.226 | 1.282 +/- 0.105 | 3.02x |
| long | 31231 | 105.184 +/- 13.350 | 25.255 +/- 1.025 | 4.16x |

### Notes

- Timings use `time.perf_counter` and report population standard deviation.
- Rust results appear only when `glitchlings._zoo_rust` imports successfully; otherwise the column is marked as unavailable.
- Re-run this script after changing pipeline code or the Rust extension to keep the comparison current.
