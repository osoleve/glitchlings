# Glitchlings Performance Benchmarks

This page is generated by `docs/build_performance_report.py` and refreshed as part of the build pipeline. It compares the pure-Python orchestrator with the optional Rust acceleration layer exposed via `glitchlings._zoo_rust`.

## Benchmark setup

- Samples per measurement: 100
- Python: 3.12.3 (CPython)
- Platform: Windows 11 [AMD64]
- Rust extension built: yes
- Generated: 2025-10-11T15:52:44.222085+00:00

## Results

| Text size | Characters | Python (ms) | Rust (ms) | Speedup |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| short | 121 | 0.283 +/- 0.079 | 0.390 +/- 0.071 | 0.73x |
| medium | 3903 | 5.305 +/- 1.292 | 1.222 +/- 0.215 | 4.34x |
| long | 31231 | 117.394 +/- 19.706 | 27.166 +/- 3.274 | 4.32x |

### Notes

- Timings use `time.perf_counter` and report population standard deviation.
- Rust results appear only when `glitchlings._zoo_rust` imports successfully; otherwise the column is marked as unavailable.
- Re-run this script after changing pipeline code or the Rust extension to keep the comparison current.
