The goal is to produce a codebase that discourages agents from writing unnecessary defensive code by keeping defensive code and functional code separate. This separation makes it clear where validation happens (boundary layers) vs. where trusted transformations occur (core logic).\n\n## Motivation\nAI coding agents tend to add defensive checks throughout code even when inputs are already validated at boundaries. By architecturally separating pure transformation logic from impure IO/validation layers, we make it obvious that core functions can trust their inputs.\n\n## Child Tasks\nTasks are linked via dependency chains. Start with glitchlings-0176 (Identify pure transformation functions) and follow the dependency tree to completion.\n\n## Success Criteria\n1. Pure transformation modules have no defensive None checks\n2. All validation happens at clearly marked boundary layers\n3. RNG state managed at boundaries, pure functions accept values\n4. Documentation guides contributors on maintaining separation\n5. AGENTS.md instructs AI agents on proper patterns","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-11-24T22:07:59.6177809-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-25T12:13:04.7343215-05:00","closed_at":"2025-11-25T12:13:04.7343215-05:00"}
