# Glitchlings Tokenizer Analyzer

Welcome to the lab! I assume you're here to break things. Good.

## What You Can Do

- Select different tokenizers to see how they process text.
- Select one or more glitchlings and set their parameters.
- Input text to see how the tokenizer's output changes based on the selected glitchlings and their parameters.
- Experiment with different combinations of tokenizers and glitchlings to understand their interactions.
- See token-level diffs, either by token id or their labels.
- View metrics describing the differences between the token sequences before and after applying glitchlings.
- View metrics for multiple tokenizers side-by-side.
- Save and load configurations of tokenizers and glitchlings for future experiments.
- Run grid sweeps over glitchling parameters and visualize the results.
- Set the seed or choose a random seed, or run multiple iterations with different seeds and see aggregated metrics.
- Export the configuration, input data, and metrics for further analysis.
- Run on a large dataset and see aggregated metrics instead of over a single input.
- Load datasets from huggingface, project gutenberg, or local files.
- Visualize token distributions and other statistics using charts and graphs.
